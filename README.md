# ODOTS Release Repository

This repository is intended to contain the latest basic ODOTS designs documentation and software, as well as be used as the source for the ODOTS homepage.

At the moment ODOTS is not covered by any license, this will change.

## ODOTS Release

At the moment development is continuing on a proof of concept design (that could be used if needed) which will be finished by the end of September 2019. Until this release all designs and software in the repository are primarily placeholders. Continuing development of the ODOTS is being recorded [here](https://justonemoreresistor.blogspot.com/search/label/ODOTS).
