## Welcome to the ODOTS 

This is the main page for the Open Design Orienteering timing system, still in development.

## What is ODOTS?

ODOTS, the Open Design Orienteering Timing System, is a project to develop a timing system for orienteering events and training that has an accessible and open design. The big advantage of this approach is a drastically reduced implementation cost, good for clubs starting up or looking to have events in high risk areas!

The ODOTS is currently still in development with a proof of concept system expected to be made before the end of September 2019.

All files for using the ODOTS can be found at its [Github Repository](https://github.com/ljones278/ODOTS-Release/), documentation can be found in the current [Specification and User Guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ljones278/ODOTS-Release/master/docs/ODOTSManualAndUserGuide.pdf) was last updated on 18 September 2019. Source Code for the embedded firmware and software interface can be found in their own repositories: [Firmware](https://github.com/ljones278/ODOTS-Firmware) and [Software](https://github.com/ljones278/ODOTS-Interface)

## Progress

Ongoing progress on the ODOTS proof of concept is being documented [here](https://justonemoreresistor.blogspot.com/search/label/ODOTS). Currently further development is waiting on the production of PCBs, in the meantime progress is continuing on writing tutorials and documentation for the Specification and User Guide.

### Contributing

The ODOTS is still very early in its development, however if you have ideas for things you would like to add, questions about the design or require support in using the ODOTS, please contact me (l.jones278).

__*13/09/2019*__ Whoop whoop, fighting with the Veroboard design finally convinced my to go and investigate PCBs. It turns out that they are far less tricky than they appear, and offer a number of advantages without that much of a cost penalty, full discussion [here](https://justonemoreresistor.blogspot.com/2019/09/pcbs-increase-in-coolness.html).

__*12/09/2019*__ Power consumption is an interesting topic for any project, no less an RF device that has to last for days unattended. Some simple tricks mean that the ODOTS has quaroupled its predicted endurance, though there is still a long way to go. Full report [here](https://justonemoreresistor.blogspot.com/2019/09/small-steps-are-never-as-easy-as-you.html).

__*12/09/2019*__ The first prototype has now been completed using the Veroboard design meaning that testing can now commence on the ODOTS hardware with a good chance of producing reliable data! Full report [here](https://justonemoreresistor.blogspot.com/2019/09/small-steps-are-never-as-easy-as-you.html).

### Thanks

The ODOTS proof of concept development has been supported by the [Orienteering Foundation](https://www.orienteeringfoundation.org.uk/).
