## What is ODOTS?

ODOTS, the Open Design Orienteering Timing System, is a project to develop a timing system for orienteering events and training that has an accessible and open design. The big advantage of this approach is a drastically reduced implementation cost, good for clubs starting up or looking to have events in high risk areas!

The ODOTS is currently still in development with a proof of concept system expected to be made before the end of September 2019.

All files for the ODOTS can be found at its [Github Repository](https://github.com/ljones278/ODOTS-Release/), the current [Specification and User Guide](https://github.com/ljones278/ODOTS-Release/master/docs/ODOTSManualAndUserGuide.pdf) was last updated on 10 September 2019.
